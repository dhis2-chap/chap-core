HpoModel implements HpoModelInterface and has a train and a predict method just like an externalModel with the same return type. Inside train a hpo loop runs over the configurations and keeps track of the best configuration. After the loop a optimial tuned model is trained on the whole dataset (train + validation) and returned. 

Inside the hpo loop a Searcher object is given the whole search space through reset and is responsible of returning a configuration when asked. Through it's tell method it can learn from past trials and suggest promising configurations in consecutive asks. 

Also inside the hpo loop an Objective object is reponsible of returning a score for each configuration. Objective is initialized with the base model specified by the user and when it's called with a configuration it calls evaluate_model (the same method evaluate calls) with the base model tuned with the given configuration.
