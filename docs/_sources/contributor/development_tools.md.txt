# Introduction to Development Tools

To get started with development, itâ€™s helpful to be familiar with some key tools:

- **Version Control (GitHub)**: Track changes to your code and collaborate with others. A good starting point is the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/).  
- **Containerisation (Docker)**: Package applications with all their dependencies to run reliably across environments. Learn the basics at the [Docker Getting Started page](https://www.docker.com/get-started).  
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: Tools like PyCharm, VS Code, or Eclipse help you write, test, and debug code efficiently. See [VS Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) or [PyCharm Guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/guide/).  
- **Python and Package Management**: Install Python and manage project dependencies with `pip` or `conda`. See [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) and [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).  
- **Virtual Environments**: Isolate project dependencies to avoid conflicts. Learn more at the [Python venv docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
