The Chap Modeling Platform
==============================================================
Chap is a Climate & Health Modeling Platform that brings together disease forecasting models into a unified ecosystem, connecting researchers with cutting-edge epidimiological models to policy makers and health practitioners. It makes complex modeling workflows accessible to users, automates rigorous model evaluation, provides a broad range of generic convenience functionality available to modellers, and integrates directly with DHIS2, the world's leading health information system.

We here provide technical documentation tailored to:

* `Model developers <external_models/index>`_
* `Platform contributors <aa>`_
* `System administrators wanting to set up Chap with connections to DHIS2 and the Modeling App <aa>`_

For more general information about the Chap project, we refer you to `the Chap Modelling Platform wiki <https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-core/wiki>`_.
