Documentation for model developers
=============================

The Chap platform brings several advantages to you as a model developer:

* It provides a `broad range of supporting functionality for modelling <supporting_functionality.html>`_, allowing you to focus on what is unique in your project, while relying on Chap for data parsing, model tuning, rigorous model assessment and more.
* It allows you to evaluate your model `side-by-side with a range of other models <side_by_side_comparison.html>`_ in the field
* It comes with `native connection to DHIS2 and the DHIS2 Modelling App <chap-dhis2-connection.html>`_, and include mechanisms to disseminate your model to a large number of health ministries that use DHIS2 as their national health information system.

We provide more detailed documentation depending on who you are:

* `Experienced climate health modellers <experienced_modeller.html>`_ who want to develop or adapt existing models to be compatible with Chap.
* `Someone new to modelling <newcomer.html>`_ that want to learn the principles of spatiotemporal modelling and how to more easily implement such models through Chap.
