# Using Chap REST API

**NOTE: The documentation about how the REST-API is working is limited.**

There are two main ways to setup the CHAP REST-API:

- For local testing purposes, the easiest way is to [setup the CHAP REST-API locally with Docker](docker-compose-doc)
- For using Chap in a production environment, it's recommended to instead follow the instructions for [setting up the CHAP REST-API on a server](../modeling-app/running-chap-on-server.md)
