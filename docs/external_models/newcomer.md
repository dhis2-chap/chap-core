# Effectively learn modelling using Chap

CHAP is designed to allow model developers to focus on their core modelling idea, and then rely on Chap for rich support of data, evaluation, interoperability and more. 
These guides introduce modelling through example models in both *Python* and *R*.

* [Learn both theoretical and practical aspects of modelling, leaning on Chap](learn_modelling.md)

We have a separate guide for those who [already know modelling](experienced_modeller.md).
