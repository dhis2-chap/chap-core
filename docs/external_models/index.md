# Documentation for Model Developers

The Chap platform brings several advantages to you as a model developer:

* It provides a [broad range of supporting functionality for modelling](supporting_functionality.md), allowing you to focus on what is unique in your project, while relying on Chap for data parsing, model tuning, rigorous model assessment and more.
* It allows you to evaluate your model [side-by-side with a range of other models](side_by_side_comparison.md) in the field
* It comes with [native connection to DHIS2 and the DHIS2 Modelling App](chap-dhis2-connection.md), and includes mechanisms to disseminate your model to a large number of health ministries that use DHIS2 as their national health information system.

We provide more detailed documentation depending on who you are:

* [Experienced climate health modellers](experienced_modeller.md) who want to develop or adapt existing models to be compatible with Chap.
* [Someone new to modelling](newcomer.md) that wants to learn the principles of spatiotemporal modelling and how to more easily implement such models through Chap.
