# Run minimalist example

At this stage, you have installed Chap Core and want to test whether chap works by running the minimalist example repo.

Ensure you are able to run this model: [https://github.com/dhis2-chap/minimalist_example_uv](https://github.com/dhis2-chap/minimalist_example_uv)

The next step is to integrate your own model into Chap.
