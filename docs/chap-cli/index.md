# Using the CLI Tool

The CHAP CLI provides commands for evaluating disease prediction models, visualizing results, and exporting metrics.

## Quick Start

The main workflow consists of three commands:

1. **`chap evaluate2`** - Run a backtest and export results to NetCDF format
2. **`chap plot-backtest`** - Generate visualizations from evaluation results
3. **`chap export-metrics`** - Export and compare metrics across evaluations

See the [Evaluation Workflow](evaluation-workflow.md) guide for detailed usage and examples.
