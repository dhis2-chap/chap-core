# Session 3 - Build your first model and run it through Chap

By the end of this session, you'll have a working model that runs through CHAP and generates a prediction report. You'll start from a template, make a small modification, and run an evaluation — the same workflow you'll use for your own models later

Before following this session, you should have completed [Session 2](../session-2). We assume you now have a system for virtual environments in either R or Python and know the basics of working on the command line, git and GitHub. It is also an advantage to have gone through [Session 1](../session-1) as well before starting this session.

## Guides

### [1. Install CHAP](install-chap.md)

Install the CHAP command-line tool using uv. This tool is required for evaluating and testing your models.

### [2. Implement your own model from a minimalist example](fork-example.md)

Fork and clone an example model repository. Choose between Python (uv) or R depending on your preferred language. Then follow the README in the repository for next steps.
