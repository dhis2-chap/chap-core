# The Chap Modeling Platform

Chap is a Climate & Health Modeling Platform that brings together disease forecasting models into a unified ecosystem, connecting researchers with cutting-edge epidemiological models to policy makers and health practitioners. It makes complex modeling workflows accessible to users, automates rigorous model evaluation, provides a broad range of generic convenience functionality available to modellers, and integrates directly with DHIS2, the world's leading health information system.

We here provide technical documentation tailored to:

* [Model developers](external_models/index.md)
* [Platform contributors](contributor/index.md)
* [System administrators wanting to set up Chap with connections to DHIS2 and the Modeling App](modeling-app/index.md)

For more general information about the Chap project, we refer you to [the Chap Modelling Platform wiki](https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-core/wiki).
