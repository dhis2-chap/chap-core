Code guidelines
----------------

In the current phase we are moving quite fast, and the code guidelines are not very strict. 

However, we have some general guidelines that we try to follow:

- Alle code that is meant to be used should be tested (see the guidelines about testing)
- It is okay to have code that is not currently being used (just write a comment to explain) 
- ... more to come here
