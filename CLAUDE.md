## Workflow

1. Always run `make lint` and `make test` after adding a feature or fixing a bug
2. No commit attribution (no co-author or generated-by lines)
3. Use conventional commits format for commit messages
4. Branch naming should follow conventional commit prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, etc.
5. No emojis in commit messages, PR descriptions, or code comments
